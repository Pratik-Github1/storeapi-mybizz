* Clean and consistent response structure

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/storeapi-mybizz.git
cd storeapi-mybizz
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure the Database

You have two options to configure the database schema:

#### Option A: Use Django's ORM

Run the following commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Make sure your model `Meta` class includes:

```python
class Meta:
    db_table = 'products'
    managed = True  # Enable this when using Django migrations
```

#### Option B: Use the Provided SQL Script

If you prefer not to run Django migrations, execute the SQL script available inside the `mysql/` folder using any MySQL client (e.g., MySQL CLI or phpMyAdmin).
This will manually create the required `products` table in your database.

> **Important:** When using this method, set `managed = False` in your modelâ€™s `Meta` class to prevent Django from trying to manage the table schema.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
